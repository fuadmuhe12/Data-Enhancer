## Overview

Background Connectivity Checker is a Flutter application designed to monitor data connectivity performance and toggle airplane mode automatically if necessary. The app runs in the background, continuously checking the internet speed and ensuring a seamless connection experience for the user.

## Features

- **Background Monitoring**: The app monitors data connectivity performance in the background, even when the app is closed.
- **Automatic Airplane Mode Toggling**: If the data connectivity performance falls below a certain threshold, the app toggles airplane mode to re-establish the connection.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can customize settings such as the check interval and internet speed threshold to suit their preferences.
- **Non-Intrusive Notifications**: The app displays notifications to alert the user when the internet speed is below the threshold, ensuring a seamless user experience.
